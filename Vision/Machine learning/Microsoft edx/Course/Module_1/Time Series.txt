Time Series :

 - A time series is a sequence of observations taken sequentially in time.
  - Regular dataset is must in time series in order to predict or else u might get wrong results 
 - Time series is used in stocks,natural pheno like wind,hearbeat,power station demands which all varies with time 
 - To predict the future for few days say the present value must be correlated with past 
 - Random generator cant predict future

Example : Milk production
 - Lets Decompose the time series graph into general trend,peroidic /sequtional and remainder
 
 DECOMPOSE
 ---------------
  1)Loess Regression (window m width)

 - Define the window width m (should be less than 0.05 of ur dataset)ie in plot we select width of 0.05 and trace the trend 
 - Choose a weight function like triweight (1-u^2)^3 mod[u]>=1 else 0 
 - Do regression using polynomial terms from taylor series by selecting a time and sub it from the center of the window time t0 
 - The point near the center are given more weight 
 - choose losee regression papameter m so as to get soomth curve or else you get a straight line 

 2)
 Model Average method 

 -In a perodic wave select the period and find the trend from previous ten values and plot the trend 
 -Auto correlation plot of avg model gives sharp cutoff n tell the order of model 

 Xt=Et+O*Et-1+O*Et-2+... 
 example: 
 companys aunoment , and stock varition for few days 


3)
 STL -

 - it uses both losee and moving average method to find trend and periodic signals and it gets the remainder .
  - see picture


 Stationarity-

 - if Time series that has no trends is it stationary 
 - second order stationarity 
    mean const
    variance const
    autocovariance does not depend on time 

checking mean and variance graphly 

- create a box plot of regular time plot using R language
- looking at the box plot ,the box shld not vary so as to keep mean n variance const


 4)Auto Regressive Model
 
  -They are not always stationary if coeff >1 it has expo autocorrection if coeff<1 it is stationary 
  -There autocorrection is expo for stationary proces so it difficult to predict the order from data plot 
  - So we use partical autocorrelation 
  - which gives relation between Xt and Xt-2 alone leaving other team in term of it 
  
  
  5)ARMA
  
   - It uses both auto-reg and avg method 
   - Only for complex higer-order behaviour it is used  


  6)Difference:

  - Xt-X(t-1)=Et gives us the error term which is stationary 
  - so by differencing we convert non-stationary process to stationary

  7)ARIMA(0,1,1)
  
  8)open azure and ipython in juypter and run the R code

SPARTICAL DATA:

- Spatial data, also known as geospatial data, is information about a physical object that can be represented by numerical values in a geographic coordinate system

-Generally speaking, spatial data represents the location, size and shape of an object on planet Earth such as a building, lake, mountain or township. Spatial data may also include attributes that provide more information about the entity that is being represented. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or other specialized software applications can be used to access, visualize, manipulate and analyze geospatial data.

-Spatial data is usually stored as coordinates and topology, and is data that can be mapped. Spatial data is often accessed, manipulated or analyzed through Geographic Information Systems 


Example:

 Crime Rate

 - Its clumpy , it is not uniformly distrubted
 - regular data might be missed
 - We need to commute distance between the crime a and crime b 
 -Physical distance might not be the best method to find distances 


 - We need to get point in GPS co-ordinate system 
 - we can get space and time data or space and label (ex: yes or no like if clicked the mobile app , we can use regression if it is real valued

Imaage analysis:

- Images make a representation of the external form of in digital pixel format 
- It is a unstructed data
- We can find it in check detection ,address detection in postoffice , biological like cells image ,mechnical flow of water image analaysis , security video camera analysis
- 

- To analysis image its nesscary to
  - Removes noise 
  - Do image manipulation
    - Resize image
    - Rotate imaage 
  - Color balance

-Image data are generally rep. in array 
-In python there are numpy.ndarray with uint8 values in it (0 to 255)
