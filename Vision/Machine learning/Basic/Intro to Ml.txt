Into to ML:

- Accuracy is directly proportional to training data set 

More train data > tuned algorithm

Type of Data :

- Numerical (numnber ex: salary)
- Categorical(job title,rating)
-Time series (finical,timestamp on email)
-text (content of mail, -> convert it to word)
etc..

Continuous supervised learning :

- Output can be discret or continuous (not binary like slow or speed)
- it like weight of person varies with height
